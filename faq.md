Students are required to follow the requirements that are in place in the handbook at the time they officially declare a major. If the degree requirements change after a student officially declares a major, the student is not affected by the change unless that change makes it simpler for the student to graduate. Please note that the requirements may be subject to minor changes upon decision of the Schools. The Undergraduate Core Curriculum Framework has been incorporated into the programs. Students study a minimum of 240 ECTS over the whole program. For the specific requirements see the degree programs in your Handbook [Academic Handbook](https://aao.nu.edu.kz/handbook)

## How to calculate my GPA and CGPA?

**How to calculate my GPA and CGPA?**

The Cumulative GPA (CGPA) is computed by dividing the total cumulative grade points by the total graded credits attempted for courses taken in residence at NU. Grade points are calculated by multiplying the number of credits by the numeric value of the grade for each course. The sum of the grade points is then divided by the total graded credits attempted. The total graded credits attempted, not the credits earned toward graduation, are used in computing the GPA.

For details, please refer to Registrar website, Home->Undergraduate Students->Grades&GPA

## How many courses can I take in Summer term?

**How many courses can I take in Summer term?**

In summer semester students are allowed to take a maximum TWO courses (up to 16 ECTS). If you are doing an internship, then only one course for registration is allowed.

## When the final examinations will take place?

All scheduled final examinations or equivalent final graded exercises are held at the end of the semester during the NU’s official final examination period. No student shall have more than two scheduled final examinations in one day. In case there are more than two final examinations scheduled in one day or two final examinations are scheduled at the same time, the student should first contact instructors of the courses for assistance in resolving conflicts. If the problem still cannot be resolved, the student should contact the Vice Dean or Dean of the School

# MAJOR/MINOR

## How to choose right major?

It is a very important decision that you have to major in during your student life. You can always make an appointment with your Advisor to discuss the choice of major. Some general tips:

Discover what your interests are? What are you good at? What subjects you really enjoyed studying and as a result they felt easier during your school years?

Read through the program of your potential major in your Handbook. You can find a list of required courses and a possible 4 year schedule of classes.

Transfer will go into effect in the following semester after approval of the application. Please, visit the School website you wish to transfer and make yourself familiar with future major (program, course requirements and future perspectives), talk to senior students of this major and try your best to make an informed decision about your major.

## What is Double major?
