## Configuration

To configure the bot, create aÂ `.env`Â file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
MODERATOR_CHAT_ID=your_moderator_chat_id
ADVISOR_USER_IDS=comma_separated_advisor_user_ids
```

- **`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`**: Required. Get this fromÂ [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**: Optional for basic testing. Get this fromÂ [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
- **`MODERATOR_CHAT_ID`**: Optional. The chat ID where moderator notifications are sent.
- **`ADVISOR_USER_IDS`**: Optional. Comma-separated list of Telegram user IDs with advisor privileges (e.g.,Â `123456,789101`).

Additionally:

- Place your FAQ content inÂ `faq.md`Â in the project root. The bot uses this to generate responses.

## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the projectâ€™s modular structure:

- **`config.py`**: Environment variables and constants.
- **`logging.py`**: Logging configuration.
- **`openai_client.py`**: OpenAI integration for generating responses.
- **`utils.py`**: Utility functions (e.g., markdown sanitization).
