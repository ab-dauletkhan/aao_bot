# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

community include:

  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language

## Project-Specific Guidelines

Given that this project is an educational FAQ bot, we also expect:

### For Code Contributors
* **Code Quality**: Follow established coding standards and include appropriate tests
* **Documentation**: Clearly document new features and changes
* **Security Awareness**: Be mindful of security implications, especially around API keys and user data
* **Educational Focus**: Keep the educational mission in mind when proposing features

### For Content Contributors
* **Accuracy**: Ensure FAQ content is accurate and helpful
* **Clarity**: Write in clear, accessible language appropriate for students
* **Relevance**: Keep content focused on the intended audience and use case
* **Privacy**: Respect student privacy and avoid sharing personal information

### For Community Members
* **Constructive Feedback**: Provide helpful, specific feedback on issues and pull requests
* **Patience**: Remember that contributors may have varying levels of experience
* **Collaboration**: Work together to find solutions that benefit the educational community
* **Respect for Maintainers**: Understand that maintainers volunteer their time

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to:
* All project repositories and related discussions
* Issue tracking and pull request conversations
* Community forums and chat platforms
* Social media interactions related to the project
* Project-related events and meetups

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
please report it by contacting the project maintainers at:

**Email**: [Create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ab-dauletkhan/aao_bot/issues) with the label "Code of Conduct"

When reporting, please include:
* Your contact information (if you're comfortable sharing)
* Names (GitHub usernames) of any individuals involved
* Your account of what occurred, including any relevant links or screenshots
* Any additional information that may be helpful

All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report, please tell us:
* What happened
* Where it happened (which repository, issue, etc.)
* When it happened
* Any other context you believe is relevant

## Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate the reported behavior and gather additional context
3. **Decision**: We will determine appropriate consequences based on our community standards
4. **Communication**: We will communicate our decision to relevant parties

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

of Conduct, you may appeal the decision by:

1. Sending a detailed explanation to the project maintainers
2. Providing any additional context or evidence
3. Requesting a review of the decision

Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers who were not involved in the original
decision when possible.
